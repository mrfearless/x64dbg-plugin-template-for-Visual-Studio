# x64dbg plugin template for Visual Studio

**Note: An offical x64dbg plugin template is now available [here](https://github.com/x64dbg/PluginTemplate), please use this offical instead.**

_A template for creating x64dbg plugins (x86 or x64) via Visual Studio_

_The template was created and tested with Visual Studio 2013, but may work with other versions._

## How to install and use

* Download the latest release of the x64dbg plugin template for Visual Studio, found [here](https://github.com/mrfearless/x64dbg-plugin-template-for-visual-studio/releases)
* Copy `x64dbg_plugin.zip` to the `My Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Templates\ProjectTemplates` folder
* Create a new project in Visual Studio 2013
* Select x64bg plugin as the template
* Specify name for your project and optionally location or accept defaults.
* Copy the contents of the `pluginsdk` folder from the latest snapshot of x64dbg into the project's `pluginsdk` folder that has been generated, see below for an example of where this folder is located in relation to your main projects folder.

## Example

Assuming the default projects location is `My Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects`, if you created a `testplugin` project it should have created a structure like so:

Root Projects Folder: `My Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects`

```
testplugin
  -- testplugin
     -- pluginsdk
```

Copy the contents of the `pluginsdk` folder from the latest snapshot of x64dbg into the project's `pluginsdk` folder. 
In this example: `My Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\testplugin\testplugin\pluginsdk`

After compiling you may have a folder structure like so:

Root Projects Folder: `My Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects`

```
testplugin
  -- Bin
     -- x32
	 -- x64
  -- testplugin
     -- Debug
	 -- pluginsdk
	 -- Release
```
